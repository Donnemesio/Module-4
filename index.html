  <h2>Bio tribute to The Godfather of Soul</h2>

  <p>May 3, 1933 James Brown was born in Barnwell, South Carolina. Brown was sent to Augusta, Georgia at the age of 4, to live with his aunt. Brown grew up in poverty and was dismissed from school at the age of 12 for "insufficient clothing," Brown started to work various jobs full-time. As an escape from the harsh reality of growing up Black in the rural South during the Great Depression, Brown turned to religion and to music. He sang in the church choir, where he developed his powerful and uniquely emotive voice. Brown met a singer and pianist named Bobby Byrd which both would form a friendship and musical partnership that proved to be one of the most fruitful in music history. Brown joined Byrd's R&B vocal group, The Gospel Starlighters. Browns voice and talent dominated the group and he stood out greatly. The group decided to change their names to the Famous Flames and moved to Macon, Georgia, where they performed at local nightclubs. In 1956, the Famous Flames recorded a demo tape of the song "Please, Please, Please" and played it for Ralph Bass, a talent scout for King Records. Bass was thoroughly impressed by the song, and especially by Brown's passionate and soulful crooning. He offered the group a record contract, and within months "Please, Please, Please" had reached No. 6 on the R&B charts. On December 25, 2006, after a weeklong battle with pneumonia. He was 73 years old.</p>
